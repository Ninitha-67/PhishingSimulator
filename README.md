# Phishing Simulator & Social Engineering Toolkit (Educational) üé£

## 1. Project Overview
This project is a **Phishing Simulator** built for educational purposes. It demonstrates the mechanics of a real-world phishing attack in a safe, controlled environment. The goal is to learn about **social engineering, web forms, and credential harvesting**, not to harm anyone.

The tool replicates the key phases of a phishing attack:
- Setting up a fake login page.
- Capturing user credentials (for demonstration only).
- Redirecting the user to the real page to avoid suspicion.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** Only test this on your own accounts or in a safe lab environment. Never target real users or companies.

## 2. Technologies Used
- **Operating System:** Kali Linux / Ubuntu / Debian (any Linux with PHP support)
- **Languages:** PHP, HTML
- **Tools:** Python (optional, for sending demonstration emails), Git, VS Code/Nano

## 3. Folder Structure
```
PhishingSimulator/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ website/
‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html # Cloned login page (fake)

## 4. How It Works

### Step 1: Start the PHP Web Server
```bash
cd website
php -S 0.0.0.0:8080
```
This will host your fake login page on http://localhost:8080.

### Step 2: Visit the Fake Login Page

Open your browser and go to:
```
http://localhost:8080/index.html
```

Fill in the login form (for testing purposes).

### Step 3: Capture Credentials

All submitted data is saved in credentials.txt (inside the website folder).
Example:
```
--- New Credential Harvest ---
email: test.user@example.com
password: MySuperSecretPassword123
Timestamp: 2025-08-30 20:00:00
```

### Step 4: Redirect

After submitting, the user is automatically redirected to the real website to simulate a realistic phishing scenario.

## 5. Safety & Ethical Guidelines
